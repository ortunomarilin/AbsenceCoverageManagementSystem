# Absence & Coverage Management System
A simple absence and coverage management system, build to help school district manage both employee absences, and class coverage if needed at a campus level. Through this application, school personal will be able to submit absence requests electronically, managers will be able to approve or deny those absence requests, and if coverage is needed sub-teachers will be able to accept jobs that become available due to approved teacher absences.
